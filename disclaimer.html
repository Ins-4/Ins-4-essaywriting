                                    <h2><EssayWriting class="edu"></EssayWriting>cation Disclaimer</h2>
                                    <p>We operate under a set of policies, regulations, and guidelines that are in place at all times. Our policies are published on our site, so that there is full transparency relative to how we conduct business. We ask that all of our customers review our policies, as well as this Disclaimer document. This piece explains all of our obligations to you, and the responsibilities and rights you have as you do business with us. Please understand that, as soon as you place your first order with us, you are bound by our published policies and this document.</p>
                                    <h3 class="h2">How to Request Revisions</h3>
                                    <p> <strong>Using Products Produced by Us: </strong>You agree that any product delivered to you that has been produced by us is for your own personal use. This means that you will not share it, sell it, trade it, or otherwise use it for any commercial purposes. If you do, you are in violation of our policies. As well, there may be negative consequences for you, and we are not responsible for those.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Giving Us Your Contact Information:</strong> On your order form, you will see fields for your name, email address and telephone number. Please be sure that these are correct. We use your email address to confirm your order and to let you know when your order is completed. We need your phone number in case we have any type of emergency and need to contact you quickly. We do not share customer information and protect yours at all times. If you fail to give us accurate information, however, your order may be delayed, and we cannot be responsible for that.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Cancelling and Order:</strong> This happens from time to time. If you find that you must cancel your order, you need to do so as quickly as possible because timing will affect your refund amount. If the cancellation comes in before a writer has been assigned, then you shall receive a complete refund. If, on the other hand, a writer has already begun to work on it, we will determine how much work has been done and pro-rate the refund accordingly. You are more than welcome to have a refund placed into your account to be used toward a future order.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Use of Research Resources:</strong> You will be asked to designate the number of resources to be used on your order form. If you have no specific resource requests, you writer will select those that best fit the topic and your level of schooling. If you do have a requirement for specific resources, we will ask you to upload them either on your order form or onto your account page, so that your writer has fast access to them. If you do not have the required resources, then we will have to locate them. If there is a charge to acquire those resources, we will call you so that you can remit payment for that charge immediately. We cannot start on your order until you have made this payment so please do so quickly, so as not to impact your delivery deadline.</p>
                                    <p>If you are going to be uploading resource materials, we have deadlines for that, based upon your completion deadline. Please adhere to these deadlines, so there is no delay in production.</p>
                                    <ul class="list">
                                        <li>for orders due within 12-24 hours, resources must be supplied within 30 minutes of the order placement,&nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>for orders due within 24-72 hours, there is a 1 hour deadline;&nbsp;</li>
                                        <li>for orders with a 72 hour+ deadline, resources must be received within 1 day.&nbsp;</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>In case Customer did not provide materials within the deadline for resource provision, extra payment or extra time for order completion would be required.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Re-Checking Your Order:</strong> WE urge all customers to carefully check their order details two times. First, check it before you submit it, making certain that you have all the fields filled in correctly, and that includes numbers and types of resources and, of course, you academic level and your deadline. The second opportunity for checking the details is when we send you your confirmation email. Re-check again to be sure the details are correct. If we go ahead and produce your product, and something is incorrect because you failed to check your order, then we cannot be responsible for those mistakes. We can correct it, but it may involve extra cost and, of course, extra time.</p>
                                    <p>As soon as you discover that you have made a mistake on your order, please call the customer serve desk immediately and let them know. There may be time to correct the error before the writer has gotten too far into the project.</p>
                                    <p>If you have left out any important information, we will try to contact you by email and by phone. If you do not respond to us quickly, production may be delayed, and this could impact your delivery deadline. If delivery is late because you have failed to respond in a timely manner, then we cannot be responsible.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Requesting Revisions to a Final Product:</strong> It is our policy to re-write and/or revise if a customer is not happy with any portion of the final draft. In general, the revisions are free if they do not mean a change from your original order. If they do mean a change, there will be an additional fee. Please see our Revision Policy for all of the details. It is important that you make your request for revision as quickly as possible so that changes can be made and your product re-delivered to you without impacting your deadline.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Plagiarism:</strong> We have never encountered and issue of plagiarism relative to any product that our writers have produced and that we have reviewed. This is because a plagiarism scan is performed on all written work before it is sent out to a client. If any customer should believe that s/he has received plagiarized content, we ask that the customer return the work to us along with a plagiarism report showing the content involved. We will then investigate this claim thoroughly. If we do discover that there has been plagiarism, we will issue a refund based upon the circumstances.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Technical Problems/Issues:</strong> Obviously, neither the company nor a customer can control certain things such as power outages, server failures, etc. These things could impact your delivery, but we cannot be responsible for such delays.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Payment for Your Order:</strong> You will have a shopping cart on our site, and when you have submitted your order(s), you then proceed to the checkout page. Here you will be entering your financial information to a third-party secure processor. You may pay by major credit or debit card, by wire transfer or e-check, or by PayPal. Once the payment has been approved, we go to work to get that order to the correct writer.</p>
                                    <p>Sometimes, a financial institution will request identity verifying documents. We will let you know immediately, usually by telephone, and you will need to forward a copy of a government, picture ID back to us. Please do this quickly so that there are no delays. You may take a picture and send it to us via you smart phone; you may scan and email it; you may fax it. Just be certain to supply it right away. If you fail to get it to us quickly, your order will be delayed, and we are not responsible for such a delay.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Deadlines:</strong> You will be asked to put a deadline for delivery on your order form. Please be certain that it is correct. We advise our customers to give themselves a few extra hours to review and ask for any revisions. Thus, if your deadline is really 2 days, you may want to place 18 hours on the order form. This gives you time to review the piece and ask for revisions. Only on very rare occasions have we ever missed a deadline. If we should miss your deadline through no fault of yours, you will receive a partial refund.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Customer Service/Support:</strong> In order to be available to our customers in any time zone and with any schedule, we keep our customer service desk open 24/7. We are eager to help you and to answer any of your questions or resolve any issues. Please contact us as indicated on our site - email, messaging from your account, chat, or telephone.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Legal Questions:</strong> We operate as a legal entity within the jurisdiction of or corporate headquarters. To date, there are no laws impacting the purchase of written materials from any online company; however, if you have concerns, check with your local authorities. You are responsible to know the laws the impact you.</p>

                                    <p>The best practice is for you to make your revision requests at the time of delivery and your initial review. However, you may still request them after you have taken delivery, so long as you meet our deadline requirements:</p>
